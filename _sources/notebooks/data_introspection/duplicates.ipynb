    "Now that sets of the most similar images have been computed, visually inspect them and note which data to consider removing before training. All data displayed are unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the introduction, it's not always bad to have similar samples in the dataset. It is bad practice to have duplicates across training and testing datasets, and it's important to consider the *effective* training/testing dataset size (including class breakdowns) really is. Remember that slight variation of a data sample for training can be achieved with data augmentation and applied uniformly across all training samples instead of just to a few specific samples as part of the stored dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, it's possible to evaluate the following criteria with the sets of near duplicates:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set contains train + test images:** Are there near identical data samples that span the train and test sets for that class?\n",
    "2. **Set contains only train images:** For near duplicates in the training set, is the network learning anything more by including all near-duplicates? Could some be replaced with good data augmentation methods?\n",
    "3. **Set contains only test images:** For near duplicates in the test set, is there anything new learned about the model if it is able to classify both all the near-duplicate data samples? Does this skew the reported accuracy?\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in the following results, some of the images in the same set look very different (e.g. Cluster 8), but in other lines (e.g. Cluster 1, 2, 3, etc.), the images look nearly identical. This is why it's important to perform some manual inspection of the data before removing samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if these images do not appear similar to the human eye, they are closest in the current embedding space, for the chosen layer response name. This can still provide useful information about what the network is using to distinguish between data samples, and it's recommended to look for what unites the images, and if desired, collect more data to help the network distinguish between the uniting feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anecdote:** In this notebook, a small dataset was chosen for efficiency purposes. However, duplicate analysis has been run on all of CIFAR-10, across train and test datasets, and an extremely large number of duplicates has been found. CIFAR-10 is a widely used dataset for training and evaluation purposes, but the fact that there are so many duplicates calls into question the validity of the accuracy scores reported on this dataset for different models, especially with respect to model generalization. Though this is not the first time someone has noticed this issue in the dataset, still, this dataset is widely used in the ML community. It's a lesson for all of us to always look at the data.\n",
