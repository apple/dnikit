# Data and Network Introspection Kit (DNIKit)

Data and Network Introspection Kit (DNIKit) uses the activations at hidden layers
of a neural network to understand the networkâ€™s behavior and how it is learning,
with respect to a given dataset. DNIKit algorithms can be applied to many problems,
including network compression, failure and bias analysis, dataset QA, and more.
